    <p>Hello! My name is <em>Ghita Natami</em>. I am 19 years old, my birthday is on <abbr title="April">Apr</abbr> 14<sup>th</sup> and currently reside in Gatineau, Canada. I have always been passionate about horse riding . In my free time, you can always find me playing pool. I don’t practice horse riding anymore since I leaved my home country to continue my studies in Canada. I also have a great interest in animals especially dogs .</p>
    <p>My life was not always easy, I was born with a lot of illnesses that could have killed me, I had one kidney that was too small compared to the other and which unfortunately did not work, I spent a lot of time in the hospital. At the age of three they discovered that my nephrostomy tubes did not close unlike all children at 3 years old so we decided to do my first operation . They inserted two tubes into my stomach to make them longer and to prevent urine from circulating in my body. Today I am 19 years old and I am in good health, my kidney works better and they even removed the tubes because I no longer needed them. All this to tell you that:</p> <blockquote>Sometimes you have to fight through some bad days to earn the best days of your life.<cite>(Zig Ziglar,1974)</cite></blockquote>
